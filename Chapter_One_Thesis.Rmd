## Chapter One Thesis

This document outlines the metagenomic studies utilized in chapter one of my thesis to analyze microfungi population in biological soil crust samples at the SRER


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
